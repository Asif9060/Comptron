Create a React component for a digital magazine with realistic page-flip animations in Magazine.jsx. The component should:

1. Implement an interactive flipbook interface that simulates physical magazine page turns
2. Support smooth left-to-right page transitions with 3D perspective
3. Display magazine content across multiple pages with proper pagination
4. Handle touch/click events for page navigation
5. Include customizable parameters for:
   - Page turn speed
   - Page size and dimensions
   - Turn animation curve
   - Page flip sound effects (optional)

Requirements:
- Use CSS transforms for 3D page flip animations
- Ensure responsive layout across different screen sizes
- Implement proper page preloading for smooth transitions
- Support both forward and backward page navigation
- Include visual feedback for page turning interactions
- Handle edge cases (first/last page)

The implementation should use modern React practices and maintain high performance for smooth animations. Consider using libraries like react-pageflip or turn.js for the core page-turning functionality.
